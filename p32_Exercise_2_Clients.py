"""Exercise 2.1: Clients

Imagine we have a store.
Implement the store's customer abstract class and 3 classes inheriting from it.
There are three groups of customers:
- Women
- Men
- Children

Each of these groups should be addressed in a different way:
women as Madam, men as Mr, and no prefixes for children.

Each inherited class should have its own string representation.
